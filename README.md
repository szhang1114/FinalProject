# FinalProject
# The Little Weather Widget
Ever been so lazy that you were incapable of opening your browser and checking the weather or turning your head slightly to check the time?

Yeah me neither
# Purpose
Our final project is a GUI that checks the weather without the frills and resource draw of a full fledged browser.

No longer will your RAM be completely consumed by the mysterious beast in chrome.

It also checks system time, if you are unable to look to the top left or right of the screen.

# Working features:
0. Through the weather API, you can select a city in the drop down menu and then press search button to get the temperature and weather of that city.
1. You can click the clock button to get the time, and it will keep running to update the time.
2. Whenever a button is clicked, a random counter will update and cause the next change of the widget to change the background color. 

# Unresolved bugs:
0. When you first run the clock widget, there is a breif delay.
1. Sometimes, the information that appear on the GUI will be blury. But if you change the panel again, the information will appear clear again.  

# How to use:
0. Attain internet access
1. Compile and run like you would a normal java program.
2. Click button for time or weather
3. If you want to check weather, select city from the dropdown menu and click the serach button next to it. 

# IMPORTANT USAGE NOTE:
Do not click the check-weather button more than 10 times a minute.
Its a limitation of the free plan for api.wunderground.

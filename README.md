Our Project is a GUI that allows you to check the weather of certain cities and the local time based on your computer's current time.

Working features:
1. Through the weather API, you can select a city in the drop down menu and then press search button to get the temperature and weather of that city.
2. You can click the clock button to get the time, and it will keep running to update the time.
3. Whenever a button is clicked, a random counter will update and cause the next change of the widget to change the background color. 

Unresolved bugs:
1. When you first run the clock widget, there is a breif delay.
2. Sometimes, the information that appear on the GUI will be blury. But if you change the panel again, the information will appear clear again.  
3.

To compile and run our code:
  Go to the Final directory in our FinalProject repository. Compile Final.java and then run it. 
  
To use our program you simpley click on the avaible buttons with the labeled feature.
